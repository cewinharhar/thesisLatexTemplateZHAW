Especially, ketoreductase ({KRED})-catalyzed transformations of ketones to yield chiral secondary alcohols have become an established biocatalytic process step in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry. Development time, however, remains a critical factor in chemical process development and thus, the competitiveness of a biocatalytic reaction step is often governed by the availability of off-the-shelf enzyme libraries. To expand the biocatalytic toolbox with additional ketoreductases, we established a multi-faceted screening procedure to capture {KRED} diversity from different sources, such as literature, available genome data, and uncharacterized microbial strains. Overall, we built a library consisting of 51 {KRED} enzymes, 29 of which have never been described in literature before. Notably, 18 of the newly described enzymes exhibited anti-Prelog preference complementing the majority of ketoreductases which generally follow Prelog's rule. Analysis of the library's catalytic activity toward a chemically diverse ketone substrate set of pharmaceutical interest further highlighted the broad substrate scope and the complementing enantio-preference of the individual {KREDs}. Using the generated sequence-function data of the included short chain dehydrogenases in a bioinformatic analysis led to the identification of possible sequence determinants of the stereospecificity exhibited by these enzymes.},

	abstract = {The Rossmann fold is one of the most common and widely distributed super-secondary structures. It is composed of a series of alternating beta strand (β) and alpha helical (α) segments wherein the β-strands are hydrogen bonded forming a β-sheet. The initial beta-alpha-beta (βαβ) fold is the most conserved segment of Rossmann folds. As this segment is in contact with the {ADP} portion of dinucleotides such as {FAD}, {NAD}, and {NADP} it is also called as an '{ADP}-binding βαβ fold'. The Proteopedia entry on the Rossmann fold (Available at: http://proteopedia.org/w/Rossmann\_fold) was generated to illustrate several structural aspects of super families of {FAD} and {NAD}(P) binding proteins: (1) The coenzymes {FAD} and {NAD}(P) share the basic adenosine diphosphate ({ADP}) structure. (2) The βαβ fold motif that is common to both {FAD} and {NAD}(P) binding enzymes accommodates the common {ADP} component of these two coenzymes. (3) In both {FAD} and {NAD}(P) binding sites, the tight turn between the first β-strand and the α-helix is in contact with the two phosphate groups of {ADP}. (4) This hairpin curve includes the first two conserved glycines (Gly-x-Gly) that allow the sharp turn of the polypeptide backbone. (5) The two β-strands of the βαβ fold may constitute the core of a larger β-sheet that may include up to seven β-strands generally in parallel orientation. (6) The structures of segments between additional strands vary greatly and may be composed of a variety of structures such as multiple short helices or coils. © 2015 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 43(3):206–209, 2015.},

	abstract = {Mutants of Lactobacillus kefir short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase, used here as ketoreductases ({KREDs}), enantioselectively reduce the pharmaceutically relevant substrates 3-thiacyclopentanone and 3-oxacyclopentanone. These substrates differ by only the heteroatom (S or O) in the ring, but the {KRED} mutants reduce them with different enantioselectivities. Kinetic studies show that these enzymes are more efficient with 3-thiacyclopentanone than with 3-oxacyclopentanone. X-ray crystal structures of apo- and {NADP}+-bound selected mutants show that the substrate-binding loop conformational preferences are modified by these mutations. Quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations are used to investigate the mechanism of reduction by the enzyme. We have developed an {MD}-based method for studying the diastereomeric transition state complexes and rationalize different enantiomeric ratios. This method, which probes the stability of the catalytic arrangement within the theozyme, shows a correlation between the relative fractions of catalytically competent poses for the enantiomeric reductions and the experimental enantiomeric ratio. Some mutations, such as A94F and Y190F, induce conformational changes in the active site that enlarge the small binding pocket, facilitating accommodation of the larger S atom in this region and enhancing S-selectivity with 3-thiacyclopentanone. In contrast, in the E145S mutant and the final variant evolved for large-scale production of the intermediate for the antibiotic sulopenem, R-selectivity is promoted by shrinking the small binding pocket, thereby destabilizing the pro-S orientation.},

Sequence identities are low, and the most conserved feature is an α/β folding pattern with a central beta sheet flanked by 2–3 α-helices from each side, thus a classical Rossmannfold motif for nucleotide binding. The conservation of this element and an active site, often with an Asn-Ser-Tyr-Lys tetrad, provides a platform for enzymatic activities encompassing several {EC} classes, including oxidoreductases, epimerases and lyases. The common mechanism is an underlying hydride and proton transfer involving the nicotinamide and typically an active site tyrosine residue, whereas substrate specificity is determined by a variable C-terminal segment. Relationships exist with bacterial haloalcohol dehalogenases, which lack cofactor binding but have the active site architecture, emphasizing the versatility of the basic fold in also generating hydride transfer-independent lyases. The conserved fold and nucleotide binding emphasize the role of {SDRs} as scaffolds for an {NAD}(P)(H) redox sensor system, of importance to control metabolic routes, transcription and signalling.},

Enzyme catalysis has been scaled up for commercial processes in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries, although further enhancements in stability and biocatalyst functionality are required for optimal biocatalytic processes in the energy sector for biofuel production and in natural gas conversion. The technical barriers associated with the implementation of immobilized enzymes suggest that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the development of immobilized biocatalysts applicable in such industrial-scale processes. Specifically, the overlap of technical expertise in enzyme immobilization, protein and process engineering will define the next generation of immobilized biocatalysts and the successful scale-up of their induced processes. This review discusses how biocatalysis has been successfully deployed, how enzyme immobilization can improve industrial processes, as well as focuses on the analysis tools critical for the multi-scale implementation of enzyme immobilization for increased product yield at maximum market profitability and minimum logistical burden on the environment and user.},

ABSTRACT = {Biocatalysis has undergone a remarkable transition in the last two decades, from being considered a niche technology to playing a much more relevant role in organic synthesis today. Advances in molecular biology and bioinformatics, and the decreasing costs for gene synthesis and sequencing contribute to the growing success of engineered biocatalysts in industrial applications. However, the incorporation of biocatalytic process steps in new or established manufacturing routes is not always straightforward. To realize the full synthetic potential of biocatalysis for the sustainable manufacture of chemical building blocks, it is therefore important to regularly analyze the success factors and existing hurdles for the implementation of enzymes in large scale small molecule synthesis. Building on our previous analysis of biocatalysis in the Swiss manufacturing environment, we present a follow-up study on how the industrial biocatalysis situation in Switzerland has evolved in the last four years. Considering the current industrial landscape, we record recent advances in biocatalysis in Switzerland as well as give suggestions where enzymatic transformations may be valuably employed to address some of the societal challenges we face today, particularly in the context of the current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.},

abstract  ="The development of a green-by-design{,} two-step{,} three-enzyme process for the synthesis of a key intermediate in the manufacture of atorvastatin{,} the active ingredient of the cholesterol lowering drug Lipitor®{,} is described. The first step involves the biocatalytic reduction of ethyl-4-chloroacetoacetate using a ketoreductase (KRED) in combination with glucose and a NADP-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) for cofactor regeneration. The (S) ethyl-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyrate product is obtained in 96\% isolated yield and >99.5\% e.e. In the second step{,} a halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) is employed to catalyse the replacement of the chloro substituent with cyano by reaction with HCN at neutral pH and ambient temperature. The natural enzymes were highly selective but exhibited productivities that were insufficient for large scale application. Consequently{,} in vitro enzyme evolution using gene shuffling technologies was employed to optimise their performance according to predefined criteria and process parameters. In the case of the HHDH reaction{,} this afforded a 2500-fold improvement in the volumetric productivity per biocatalyst loading. This enabled the economical and environmentally attractive production of the key hydroxynitrile intermediate. The overall process has an E factor (kg waste per kg product) of 5.8 when process water is not included{,} and 18 if included."}

The potential of (R)-{HPBE} production process has also been intensively evaluated.

	abstract = {Modeling and analysis of genetic networks have become increasingly important in the investigation of cellular processes. The genetic networks involved in cellular stress response can have a critical effect on the productivity of recombinant proteins. In this work, it was found that the temperature-inducible expression system for the production of soluble recombinant streptokinase in Escherichia coli resulted in a lower productivity compared to the chemically-induced system. To investigate the effect of the induced cellular response due to temperature up-shift a model-based approach is adopted. The role played by the major molecular chaperone teams {DnaK}–{DnaJ}–{GrpE} and {GroEL}–{GroES} on the productivity of recombinant streptokinase was experimentally determined. Based on these investigations, a detailed mechanistic mathematical model was developed for the cellular response during the temperature-induced recombinant streptokinase production. The model simulations were found to have a good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. The mechanistic mathematical model was validated with the experiments conducted on a σ32 mutant strain. Detailed analysis of the parameter sensitivities of the model indicated that the level of free {DnaK} chaperone in the cell has the major effect on the productivity of recombinant streptokinase during temperature induction. Analysis of the model simulations also shows that down regulation or selective redirection of the heat shock proteins could be a better way of manipulating the cellular stress response than overexpression or deletion. In other words, manipulating the system properties resulting from the interaction of the components is better than manipulating the individual components. Although our results are specific to a recombinant protein (streptokinase) and the expression system (E. coli), we believe that such a systems-biological approach has several advantages over conventional experimental approaches and could be in principle extended to bigger genetic networks as well as other recombinant proteins and expression systems.},

abstract = {Completed eukaryotic genomes were screened for medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (MDR). In the human genome, 23 MDR forms were found, a number that probably will increase, because the genome is not yet fully interpreted. Partial sequences already indicate that at least three further members exist. Within the MDR superfamily, at least eight families were distinguished. Three families are formed by dimeric alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH; originally detected in animals/plants), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (originally detected in plants) and tetrameric alcohol dehydrogenases (originally detected in yeast). Three further families are centred around forms initially detected as mitochondrial respiratory function proteins, acetyl-CoA reductases of fatty acid synthases, and leukotriene B4 dehydrogenases. The two remaining families with polyol dehydrogenases (originally detected as sorbitol dehydrogenase) and quinone reductases (originally detected as ζ-crystallin) are also distinct but with variable sequences. The most abundant families in the human genome are the dimeric ADH forms and the quinone oxidoreductases. The eukaryotic patterns are different from those of Escherichia coli. Thedifferent families were further evaluated by molecular modelling of their active sites as to geometry, hydrophobicity and volume of substrate-binding pockets. Finally, sequence patterns were derived that are diagnostic for the different families and can be used in genome annotations.},

abstract = {A comprehensive, structural and functional, in silico analysis of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) superfamily, including 583 proteins, was carried out by use of extensive database mining and the blastp program in an iterative manner to identify all known members of the superfamily. Based on phylogenetic, sequence, and functional similarities, the protein members of the MDR superfamily were classified into three different taxonomic categories: (a) subfamilies, consisting of a closed group containing a set of ideally orthologous proteins that perform the same function; (b) families, each comprising a cluster of monophyletic subfamilies that possess significant sequence identity among them and might share or not common substrates or mechanisms of reaction; and (c) macrofamilies, each comprising a cluster of monophyletic protein families with protein members from the three domains of life, which includes at least one subfamily member that displays activity related to a very ancient metabolic pathway. In this context, a superfamily is a group of homologous protein families (and/or macrofamilies) with monophyletic origin that shares at least a barely detectable sequence similarity, but showing the same 3D fold. The MDR superfamily encloses three macrofamilies, with eight families and 49 subfamilies. These subfamilies exhibit great functional diversity including noncatalytic members with different subcellular, phylogenetic, and species distributions. This results from constant enzymogenesis and proteinogenesis within each kingdom, and highlights the huge plasticity that MDR superfamily members possess. Thus, through evolution a great number of taxa-specific new functions were acquired by MDRs. The generation of new functions fulfilled by proteins, can be considered as the essence of protein evolution. The mechanisms of protein evolution inside MDR are not constrained to conserve substrate specificity and/or chemistry of catalysis. In consequence, MDR functional diversity is more complex than sequence diversity. MDR is a very ancient protein superfamily that existed in the last universal common ancestor. It had at least two (and probably three) different ancestral activities related to formaldehyde metabolism and alcoholic fermentation. Eukaryotic members of this superfamily are more related to bacterial than to archaeal members; horizontal gene transfer among the domains of life appears to be a rare event in modern organisms.},

Despite the emergence of eukaryotic expression systems, bacteria remain a cost effective and powerful tool for protein production. The T7 {RNA} polymerase (T7RNAP)-based expression system is a successful and efficient expression system, which achieves high-level production of proteins. However some foreign {MPs} require a fine-tuning of their expression to minimize the toxicity associated with their production. Here we report a novel regulation mechanism for the T7 expression system. We have isolated two bacterial hosts, namely C44({DE}3) and C45({DE}3), harboring a stop codon in the T7RNAP gene, whose translation is under the control of the basal nonsense suppressive activity of the {BL}21({DE}3) host. Evaluation of hosts with superfolder green fluorescent protein ({sfGFP}) revealed an unprecedented tighter control of transgene expression with a marked accumulation of the recombinant protein during stationary phase. Analysis of a collection of twenty {MP} fused to {GFP} showed an improved production yield and quality of several bacterial {MPs} and of one human monotopic {MP}. These mutant hosts are complementary to the other existing T7 hosts and will increase the versatility of the T7 expression system.},

The current T7 system for pac overexpression was fraught with various technical hurdles. Upon the induction with a conventional inducer of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside ({IPTG}), the production of {PAC} was limited by the accumulation of {PAC} precursors ({proPAC}) as inclusion bodies and various negative cellular responses such as growth inhibition and cell lysis. The expression performance could be improved by the coexpression of {degP} encoding a periplasmic protein with protease and chaperone activities. In addition to {IPTG}, arabinose was shown to be another effective inducer. Interestingly, arabinose not only induced the current T7 promoter system for pac expression but also facilitated the posttranslational processing of {proPAC} for maturation, resulting in significant enhancement for the production of {PAC}. Glycerol appeared to have an effect similar to, but not as significant as, arabinose for enhancing the production of {PAC}. The study highlights the importance of developing suitable genetically engineered strains with culture conditions for enhancing recombinant protein production in E. coli.},
